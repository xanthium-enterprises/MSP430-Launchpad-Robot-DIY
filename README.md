A short introduction to Robotics using **MSP430** microcontroller and Launchpad development board from TI.
Here we will build a small differential powered robot from scratch using MSP430G2553 controller and L293D motor control chip.

Tutorial follows a **DIY ethic** and can be assembled easily with things lying around in your garage

## Overview

##Features of the Robot
 - MSP430 based controller (MSP430G2553) for providing the intelligence to the robot.
 - Differential Drive configuration using two geared motors(12V),No caster wheel (robot slides on a cardboard notch at the back)
 - 6 bit external port for connecting line sensors, IR obstacle sensors, wheel encoders etc.
 - **L293D** based motor control for locomotion.
 - **RS485** based serial communication.
 - Uses standard battery or a power cord tethered to a DC source(No rechargeable battery or charging circuit is provided to minimize cost and complexity)
